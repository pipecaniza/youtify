### How to run it locally

To execute this project locally you have to download also the [backend project](https://github.com/pipecaniza/youtify-server) implemented in json-server.

Create a project in [google](https://console.developers.google.com) and add a YouTube Data API v3 and also create credentials with OAuth 2.0, copy the key of the YouTube Data API v3 into `/apis/youtube.js` and the key generated by the credentials in `/containers/GoogleAuthContainer.js`.

The last step is execute `npm start` in either frontend and backend projects and enjoy!

**Note: this project uses youtube API, this API has a limited number of requests and after that you have to wait 24hours to be able to use it again**
